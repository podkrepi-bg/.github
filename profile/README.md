## Hi there! 

This is the welcome page of the Podkrepi.bg github organization!

We are developing an open-source charity platform with maximum transparency, that helps ensuring that donated funds are used for the needed cause. The paltform does not collect management fees from the donations and all contributors are working pro-bono.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

👋 Before You Start
  - Read our Manifesto in EN here: https://docs.podkrepi.bg/general/master/manifest 
  - Read our Manifesto in BG here: https://docs.podkrepi.bg/general/master/manifest
  - and then join in

🌈 Contribution guidelines:
 - We have two main repositories of the platform: the frontend https://github.com/podkrepi-bg/api and the backend https://github.com/podkrepi-bg/api
 - Start by setting up your frontend and backend locally reading the instructions in the frontend/README.MD
 - Check the issues and select one you'd like to work on - write in it so that it can be assigned to you 
 - We work with forks, submit PRs, review, aprove and only maintainers can merge and deploy
 - The automated tests will help you add improvements safely, please extend them too
 
👩‍💻 Communication:
 - Our Discord community server here: https://discord.com/invite/nZAeCb9YzP 
 - When you join follow the instructions to present yourself and contact a community lead in the arrea of your contribution
 - We hold a common meeting every Wednesday 19h EET
